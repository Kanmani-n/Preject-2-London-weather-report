üå¶Ô∏è WEATHER-OBERSERVATION-OF-LONDON---REGRESSION-MODEL-BUILDING-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-

OBJECTIVE
The objective is to develop accurate regression models for forecasting maximum daily temperature (Q_TX) in London, by leveraging meteorological features, performing robust preprocessing, and extracting meaningful climate insights.Study the distribution of Q_TX and its relationship with other meteorological variables (humidity, sunshine, rainfall, air pressure, etc.) is its basic objective.Identifing the trends, seasonality, and correlations that directly influence maximum temperature.
